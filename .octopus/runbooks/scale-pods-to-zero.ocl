        **WARNING**: This is a destructive operation. The service will no longer be available when scaled down.
        
        **Action**: Scales the deployment down to zero pods.
        
        **Affects**: The products service is effectively shut down.
        
        This runbook is designed to be be run in non-production environments after hours to remove the Fargate nodes hosting
        the service. This removes the cost of hosting the service out of hours.
